A WORKING DIGITAL CLOCK USING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
In the css part of the code, 
font-size: medium; and font-family: ...; are applied to all elements using the universal selector (*).background, width, height, position, top, left, right, bottom, and transform are used to style the .hero and .container classes, creating the gradient background, positioning the container in the center of the viewport, and applying a transform to center it further.background, border-radius, position, left, top, right, bottom, and z-index are used for the circular background elements created using ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.font-size, width, display, text-align, position, and transform are applied to style the clock's digits and labels. ::after pseudo-elements are used to display the labels below the digits.backdrop-filter is used to apply a blur effect to the .clock class, creating a frosted glass effect.These properties collectively style and position the elements in the HTML document to achieve the desired visual appearance.

In the JavaScript part of the code,
let hrs = document.getElementById("hrs");, let min = document.getElementById("min");, let sec = document.getElementById("sec");:These lines retrieve the HTML elements with the IDs hrs, min, and sec and store them in variables hrs, min, and sec, respectively. These elements are the placeholders where the hours, minutes, and seconds will be displayed.setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000);:setInterval is a JavaScript function that repeatedly executes a provided function or code block at a specified interval (in milliseconds). In this case, the provided function updates the content of the hrs, min, and sec elements every second (1000 milliseconds).let currentTime = new Date();:This line creates a new Date object representing the current date and time.hrs.innerHTML = (currentTime.getHours() < 10 ? "0" : "") + currentTime.getHours();:currentTime.getHours() gets the current hour value from the Date object.(currentTime.getHours() < 10 ? "0" : "") adds a leading zero to single-digit hours.hrs.innerHTML sets the content of the hrs element to the formatted hour value.Similarly, the min and sec elements are updated with formatted minutes and seconds values, ensuring that single-digit minutes and seconds are prefixed with a zero for consistency.This JavaScript code continuously updates the displayed time on the webpage, ensuring that the clock always shows the current hour, minute, and second values.
